Emacs Evil-Search-Highlight-Persist Minor Mode
==============================================

This Emacs extension will make `isearch` and `evil-ex-search-incremental` (the "slash
search") to highlight the search term (taken as a regexp) in all the buffer and
persistently until you make another search or clear the highlights with the
search-highlight-persist-remove-all command (default binding to `C-x SPC`). This
is how Vim search works by default when you enable hlsearch. This extension requires the 
"highlight" extension.

To enable:

    (require 'highlight)
    (require 'evil-search-highlight-persist)
    (global-evil-search-highlight-persist t)
    
    ;; To only display string whose length is greater than or equal to 3
    ;; (setq evil-search-highlight-string-min-len 3)
    

Please use unhighlight-regexp to remove all highlights, like:
    
    (global-set-key [f12] 'unhighlight-regexp)
